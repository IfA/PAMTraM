# PAMTraM Casestudy: Visu+

This casestudy implements a transformation that is analogous to the one presented in the [AutoProBe Casestudy](../de.mfreund.pamtram.casestudies.autoprobe/README.md) but with a different target metamodel.

## Additional Information and Resources

The source modeling language of the transformation is *STGML* - an extension of the Statechart Modeling Language [SCXML] that allows to attach visualization layers to states.

The target modeling language of the transformation is made up of a couple of metamodels that describe the various aspects of projects that are based on the industrial visualization system *Visu+* from [Phoenix Contact](https://www.phoenixcontact.com/).
