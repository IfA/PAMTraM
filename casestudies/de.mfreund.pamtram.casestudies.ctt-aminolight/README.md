# PAMTraM Casestudy: CTT-Amino Light

This casestudy performs a transformation between task models based on the [Concur Task Trees][CTT] (CTT) metamodel and a simplified version of the *Amino-UI* modeling language that is currently developed by Lukas Baron at the [Institute of Automation at TU Dresden][Institute of Automation]. Thereby, platform conditions that are based on a platform metamodel are evaluated.
