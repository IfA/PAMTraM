# PAMTraM Casestudy: W3CAUI-Movisa

This casestudy implements a transformation between an AUI modeling language and Movisa. Thereby, platform conditions that are based on a platform metamodel are evaluated.

## Additional Information and Resources

The source modeling language of the transformation is the [AUI modeling language proposed by the W3C][W3CAUI]. 

The target modeling language of the transformation is *Movisa* - a modeling language for industrial UIs that was created by Stefan Henning during his time at the [Institute of Automation at TU Dresden][Institute of Automation]. The Movisa language is described in detail in his [PhD thesis](http://www.vogtverlag.de/buecher/9783938860496.html). 

**Note:** Due to copyright reasons, the Movisa metamodel cannot be distributed freely. Thus, this casestudy cannot be executed out of the box. For enquiries about the additionally required ressources, please contact [Matthias Freund](mailto:matthias.freund@tu-dresden.de) or any other member of the [Institute of Automation].
