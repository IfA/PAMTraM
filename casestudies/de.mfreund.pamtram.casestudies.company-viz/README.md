# PAMTraM Casestudy: Company-Visualization

This casestudy performs a transformation between a simple metamodel for describing *Companies* that have employees and products and a metamodel for describing *Visualizations* that consist of several panels and navigation flows.

## Additional Information and Resources

In order to visualize generated target models, the `visualization2html` folder contains an additional (model-to-text) transformation written in [Xpand]. This transformation can be configured in the `visualization2html.mwe` file and launched via `Right Click (on the mwe file) -> Run as... -> MWE Workflow`.
