# PAMTraM Casestudy: Excel-Movisa TDP

This casestudy implements a transformation between a metamodel to describe Modbus TCP-based process variables and the UI-modeling language Movisa.

## Additional Information and Resources

The source metamodel as well as the source model were automatically generated based on a simple Excel table by means of an algorithm that was developed by Martin Kriebel during his thesis.

The target modeling language of the transformation is *Movisa* - a modeling language for industrial UIs that was created by Stefan Henning during his time at the [Institute of Automation at TU Dresden][Institute of Automation]. The Movisa language is described in detail in his [PhD thesis](http://www.vogtverlag.de/buecher/9783938860496.html). 

**Note:** Due to copyright reasons, the Movisa metamodel cannot be distributed freely. Thus, this casestudy cannot be executed out of the box. For enquiries about the additionally required ressources, please contact [Matthias Freund](mailto:matthias.freund@tu-dresden.de) or any other member of the [Institute of Automation].
