/**
 * This class implements a concrete {@link ComposedAmbiguityResolvingStrategy} that consults previous resolving 
 * results in order to resolve ambiguities and additionally can compose multiple other resolving strategies. 
 * <p />
 * Any call to a method defined by the {@link IAmbiguityResolvingStrategy} interface will first check if
 * a previous resolving result is present for the given configuration. If this is the case, it uses this
 * result; otherwise, it iteratively forwards the call to every of the {@link #composedStrategies} and 
 * returns the final result. The result is also stored for future ambiguity evaluation requests.
